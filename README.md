<p1>The program displays a menu with options to add, view, update, delete, or exit the student management system. When a new student is added, it confirms the action by showing the student’s ID, name, age, and grade stored in the system. Viewing students lists all saved records, while updating allows changes to an existing student’s details and shows a confirmation message. Deleting a student removes the record and displays
a deletion message. If no students exist, the program notifies the user. Invalid inputs are handled with warning messages, and choosing the exit option ends the program with a farewell message.  </p1>
